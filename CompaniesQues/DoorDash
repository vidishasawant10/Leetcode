Question
You are given an m × n board representing a delivery area. The board contains:

'X' - blockers (obstacles)
'D' - DashMarts (pickup locations)
' ' - empty spaces where dashers can travel
A dasher can be located on any spot of the board. Your task is to find the distance from a dasher's position to the closest DashMart. The dasher can travel in 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

Note: A dasher can be on a blocker cell 'X'.

Return -1 if no DashMart is reachable.

Part 1 — Distance to Closest DashMart
Given a board and a starting position, return the minimum distance to the closest DashMart.

Example 1
Input:

board = [
  [' ', ' ', 'D'],
  [' ', 'X', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ']
]
start = (0, 0)
Output: 2

Explanation: The closest DashMart at (0, 2) is 2 steps away: right → right.

Example 2
Input:

board = [
  ['X', 'X', 'X'],
  ['X', 'D', 'X'],
  ['X', 'X', 'X']
]
start = (0, 0)  # dasher on blocker
Output: -1

Explanation: The dasher is surrounded by blockers and cannot reach the DashMart.

Part 2 — All Closest DashMarts
For a given position, return the coordinates of all DashMarts that have the shortest distance. If multiple DashMarts are at the same minimum distance, return all of them.

Example 3
Input:

board = [
  ['D', ' ', 'D'],
  [' ', ' ', ' '],
  ['D', ' ', ' ']
]
start = (1, 1)
Output: [(0, 1), (1, 0)] or [(2, 1), (1, 0)]

Explanation:

Distance to (0, 0): 2
Distance to (0, 2): 2
Distance to (2, 0): 2
All three DashMarts are at distance 2. Return any two (or all if you prefer).

Input Format
# Board is represented as a 2D list of characters
board: List[List[str]]  # Each cell is ' ', 'X', or 'D'

# Starting position as (row, col) tuple
start: Tuple[int, int]
Constraints
1 <= m, n <= 1000
The board contains at least one cell
DashMarts may be unreachable from some positions
Time complexity should be O(m × n) per query for Part 1
Consider input validation for edge cases
Follow-up Questions
How would you optimize if you need to answer multiple queries on the same board?
What if the board changes dynamically (DashMarts open/close)?
